    <h2>Prologue: The Kingdom That Forgot Itself</h2>
    <p>There once stood a kingdom at the edge of the world, wrapped in clouds and myths, where the sun touched the mountains like a hesitant lover, and the stars whispered names no longer spoken.</p>
    <p>But the strangest thing about this kingdom… is that it forgot it ever existed.</p>
    <p>And perhaps that is the most human thing a kingdom can do.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 1: The Sound of Dust</h2>
    <p>The wind came first, soft and uncertain, like a boy’s first apology. Then came the silence — heavier than stone, more telling than any scream.</p>
    <p>A young woman stood alone before the ruins.</p>
    <p>Her name was <strong>Meera</strong>.</p>
    <p>Not the kind of Meera who danced in temples with anklets that chimed love songs — this Meera did not believe in gods. Or at least, she pretended not to.</p>
    <p>She was quiet — not the kind of quiet that waits, but the kind that remembers. Her eyes carried the hue of forgotten stories, and her breath trembled with questions the world no longer asked.</p>
    <p>The ruins in front of her were choked with wild fig roots and broken archways. Yet there was something unexplainably… alive. As though the stones still mourned.</p>

    <div class="narrator">
      I am here again. I always come when grief begins to whisper instead of scream. Most don’t notice me. But some feel the weight of a second presence — like Meera did.
    </div>

    <p>She touched a wall — the dust didn’t resist her fingers. And for a second, the wind paused.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 2: The Throne of Echoes</h2>
    <p>Inside the sanctum, where kings once held court and queens once bled silence into golden corridors, there remained only one thing untouched: a throne.</p>
    <p>Cracked, cold, and strangely warm at the same time.</p>
    <p>Meera sat. Not because she desired power — no, power had already made fools of her ancestors — but because she was tired. And the throne, despite its weight, felt… honest.</p>
    <p>She had been searching. But not for treasure. Not for truth.</p>
    <p>She was looking for <em>meaning</em>.</p>

    <div class="narrator">
      She doesn’t know that the search for meaning is the cruelest of all pilgrimages. It ends not with answers, but with mirrors.
    </div>

    <p>Her hand fell to her lap. Her mother’s ring still clung to her finger. The last gift before the fire. Before the silence.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 3: The Voice of Stone</h2>
    <p>A whisper.</p>
    <p>No louder than a leaf folding under moonlight.</p>
    <p>“Why have you come?”</p>
    <p>She froze. “Who’s there?”</p>
    <p>No one. And yet… someone.</p>
    <p>“I asked a question,” it said again. The voice sounded… ancient. Not in age, but in memory.</p>
    <p>Meera stood up. “I came for what was lost.”</p>
    <p>A pause.</p>
    <p>“Then why do you carry it still?”</p>
    <p>Her breath caught. “What?”</p>

    <div class="narrator">
      The clever ones always ask ‘what’, never ‘how’.
    </div>

    <p>The wall behind her shimmered — not visibly, but spiritually — and she saw them. Shadows of a people who never left. Soldiers whose swords rusted before their rage did. Children who never grew up because memory kept them young.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 4: The Kingdom of the Mind</h2>
    <p>The kingdom was not lost beneath the ground.</p>
    <p>It was lost <em>inside them</em> — in the minds that chose convenience over legacy, war over patience, forgetting over forgiveness.</p>
    <p>And so it decayed — not in time, but in value.</p>

    <div class="narrator">
      India’s old wisdom spoke of this. That what decays in the mind, shall fall from the world. That a kingdom is not built with stone, but with Dharma — the silent law, the inner order.
    </div>

    <p>Meera closed her eyes. And in the dark, she saw light.</p>
    <p>Not in the divine sense.</p>
    <p>But in the truthful one.</p>

    <h2>Epilogue: The Watcher</h2>

    <div class="narrator">
      She left at dawn. The throne wept, but did not call her back.<br>
      The fig roots pulled tighter — not in anger, but in relief.<br>
      Another one had remembered.
    </div>

    <p>Somewhere, in a forgotten forest where the air still listens, a kingdom breathes.</p>
    <p>Not waiting to be found — but hoping to be <strong>understood</strong>.</p>
